### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I am Chasen Jeffries, a data scientist and political economy expert pursuing a PhD in international Relations and Political Science, with a focus on International Political Economy and Computational Analytics. You can check out my [personal website](https://chasen-jeffries.github.io/) to learn more about me.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a diverse array of projects using qualitative and quantitative methods. These include a dissertation examining the impact of patent systems on innovation and economic growth, a simulation of Olson's 'Roaming vs Stationary Bandits' concept, and a predictive model for Irregular Government Change.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SQL and Tableau to enhance my data visualization and database management skills, aiming to integrate these tools into my research and analysis work. This will give me additional skills to access new datasets and enable me to articulate complex information effectively.
